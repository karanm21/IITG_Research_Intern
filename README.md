Enabling Low Power Cardiac Arrhythmia Classification on Wearable
Devices

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the primary causes of mortality worldwide, causing millions
of casualties every year. Among all the chronic CVDs, cardiac arrhythmia is the most recurrent and is
responsible for the maximum number of fatalities due to cardiac arrests. Thus, the development of
wearable devices for the timely detection of CA would enable on-time treatment to save millions of
lives.
