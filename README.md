Enabling Low Power Cardiac Arrhythmia Classification on Wearable
Devices

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the primary causes of mortality worldwide, causing millions
of casualties every year. Among all the chronic CVDs, cardiac arrhythmia is the most recurrent and is
responsible for the maximum number of fatalities due to cardiac arrests. Thus, the development of
wearable devices for the timely detection of CA would enable on-time treatment to save millions of
lives.

A Deep Neural Network (DNN) based cardiac arrhythmia (CA) classifier is suggested in this research,
and it can categorize ECG beats into normal and various types of arrhythmia beats. A time domain
ECG signal's optimized fixed length beat is taken out and used as an input by the suggested classifier.
This predetermined input beat size facilitates the optimization of our suggested architecture and
eliminates the need to manually extract ECG features. 

The classifier that we are building does not make much use of complex algorithms for CA
classification. Thus, the low power realization of the proposed system makes it suitable for wearable
healthcare device applications.
